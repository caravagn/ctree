Thee `ctree` package provides a simple implementation of *clones trees* in cancer.

clone trees that can be build of Cancer Cell Franctions (CCFs) clusters computed by tumour subclonal deconvolution. This type of models can be used to study the evolutionary trajectories of a tumour from bulk sequencing data.

Clone trees can be built from Cancer Cell Franctions (CCFs) data reporting fraction of cancer cells harbouring a somatic mutation (usually, a single-nucleotide variant) across a number of tumour regions. This type of models can be used to study the evolutionary trajectories of a tumour from bulk sequencing data, especially in setups where one can generate whole-genome sequencing data.


* `ctree` provides an S3-based implementation of mutation trees, as well as a Monte Carlo sampler that has been discussed in [Caravagna et al; PMID: 30171232](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171232). The package provides also functions to plot and analyze the trees.

* The sibling of a clone tree is a *mutation tree*,  which is obtained from the analysis of binary absence/ presence profiles of somatic variants from bulk targeted panels; mutation trees are implemented in the [mtree package](https://caravagn.github.io/mtree).

`ctree` is part of the `evoverse`, a [set of R packages](https://caravagn.github.io/evoverse) to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.
