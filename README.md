`ctree` is a package that provides the implementation of clone trees
from Cancer Cell Franctions (CCFs) data, which can be used to study a
tumourâ€™s evolutionary trajectories from bulk sequencing data.

`ctree` is part of the `evoverse`, a package that gathers multiple R
packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses; see more [about
evoverse](https://caravagn.github.io/evoverse).

The package provides methods to create the trees into S3 objects, as
well as a sampler to generate them with a Monte Carlo strategy that have
been first described in the
[revolver](https://caravagn.github.io/revolver) algorithm. The package
provides also functions to plot the trees.
